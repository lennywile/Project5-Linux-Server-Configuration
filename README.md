# Project5-Linux-Server-Configuration

#Overview

This project takes a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepares it to host a web application by installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors, and installing/configuring web and database servers.

#HTTP

The web application, The Sports Catalog, is hosted via HTTP at the server's IP address: 52.33.235.211.

http://52.33.235.211/


#SSH

To access the server, SSH into the server by executing the command:

ssh -p 2200 -i [RSA_FILE] grader@52.33.235.211

Ensure the RSA file is included and enter the password provided.
